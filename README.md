# Circulo Patient App

This project is a demo React app for a mock healthcare provider that serves
veterans of the US Military.

It is built with `create-react-app` and uses most of the default configuration.

See https://circulo.michaelphillips.dev for a working demo.

## Getting Started

To serve the app locally, from the project root you may run:

```bash
make start
```

When testing locally, make sure you have both the app and the
[server](https://github.com/michaeljoelphillips/circulo-api) running.

See the `Makefile` for other targets like `make test` and `make build`.
